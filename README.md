# Image Gallery - Bootstrap

## This Iteration:

- Add lazy loading: https://appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/
  - Have images fade in quickly, left to right, like on the author site's testimonials.
    - Alter this for mobile, when display is "block".
- Make each image a link to that specific full-size image.- Move unused images out of the img folder. Paste elsewhere on your computer.

## Future Iterations:

- Link each SVG from an external file for D.R.Y. purposes.
