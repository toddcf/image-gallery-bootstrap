# Image Gallery - Bootstrap

## This Iteration

- Add attribution SVGs.
  - Fix: After an attribution has been clicked, there is a little underline displayed next to the camera SVG. Get rid of this.
- Add alt to each image tag.
- Add hover effects to each image.
- Add box shadow behind each image.
- Add footer.
- Add lazy loading. https://responsivedesign.is/resources/javascript-jquery/lazy-load-jquery/
  - Have images fade in quickly, left to right, like on the author site's testimonials.
  - Alter this for mobile, when display is "block".
