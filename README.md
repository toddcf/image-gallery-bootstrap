Images that will take you away.

## Technology Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery
- Bootstrap 3

## Future Iterations:

- Lazy Loading:
  - Control the order in which each image loads. (Rows should load from left to right; columns from top to bottom.)
  - Offset loading trigger to be a little above the bottom of the viewport.
- Link each SVG from an external file for D.R.Y. purposes.
