- Add footer.
- Add lazy loading. https://responsivedesign.is/resources/javascript-jquery/lazy-load-jquery/
  - Have images fade in quickly, left to right, like on the author site's testimonials.
  - Alter this for mobile, when display is "block".

## Future Iterations:

- Link each SVG from an external file for D.R.Y. purposes.
